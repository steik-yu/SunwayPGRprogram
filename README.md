# Sunway post-graduate R program
This page aims to provide read-to-use R program for students who are performing basic biostatistics in R with figures. 

## Data input format
To make your life easier moving forward, format your data like the example below. It might not be as clean as the scientific table with all the redundant information, but R reads it better this way (better if replace space with _). (P.S. Yes, of course you can transform the data yourself in R, but introducing that here would make things more complicated, so)

**Example Data 1.** Colorectal Cancer Patient Raw Dataset.
| Patient_ID | Country    | Age    | Gender    | Cancer_Stage    | Tumor_Size_mm    | Family_History    | Smoking_History    | Alcohol_Consumption    | ...    |

**Example Data 2.** Cell Viability Absorbance Reading Raw Dataset. (MelastomaW: Melastoma water extract)

## Statistical Tests
0. *Data input + Assumption checking tests: Shapiro-Wilk test / Levene's test*
1. One sample t-test / One sample Wilcoxon rank sum test
2. Independent two sample t-test / Mann-Whitney U test
3. Paired samples t-test / Paired sample Wilcoxon rank sum test
4. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc test / Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
5. Two-way ANOVA with post-hoc test / Aligned Rank Transform test
6. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test / Test of Independence
7. Pearson correlation coefficient / Spearman rank correlation coefficient
8. Simple linear / Multiple linear regression / Logistic regression

## R graphs or formula for the moment
### Antioxidant assays (DPPH/ABTS)
