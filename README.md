# Sunway post-graduate R program
This page aims to provide read-to-use R program for students who are performing basic biostatistics in R with figures. 

## Statistical Tests
0. *Assumption checking tests: Shapiro-Wilk test / Levene's test*
1. One sample t-test / One sample Wilcoxon rank sum test
2. Independent two sample t-test / Mann-Whitney U test
3. Paired samples t-test / Paired sample Wilcoxon rank sum test
4. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc test / Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
5. Two-way ANOVA with post-hoc test / Aligned Rank Transform test
6. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
7. Pearson correlation coefficient / Spearman rank correlation coefficient
8. Simple linear regression
9. Multiple linear regression
10. Logistic regression
